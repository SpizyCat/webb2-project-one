          This is a Porsche Panamera Turbo S, it has a twin turbocharged V8 and
          620 horsepower at stock. It also has an Executive version, the main
          difference is the price, the Executive version also has a little bit
          more legroom which can be nice so it doesn't get so cramped in the
          car, the price difference is 177,000$ vs 188,000$ for the Executive
          version. I feel like this price is justified since I am a
          perfectionist I like to have lots of leg room for my passengers.

          This is a 1972 Ford Mustang Mach 1, it is my dream car and I would
          love to have one of these. It uses a 302ci, 2 barrel V8 engine, with a
          sport interior with high bucket seats to give you that old school
          look. The main differenace between the 72 and the 71 version was that
          it actually lost the pop-open gas cap, it got replaced with the crappy
          standard gas twist on cap. Machs 1 are usually powered by the 302
          windsor in base trim, but you could upgrade to a 351 cleveland v8 if
          you really wanted to maximize the power out of this monster.

          This is the brand new Tesla Roadster 2021, doing 1-100 km/h in the
          span of 2 seconds, over 1000 kilometers of range on one battery, a
          topspeed of over 400 km/h, all wheel-drive with a base price of just
          200,000 $. Tesla is my all time favorite car company and I love their
          cars, the interior, the exterior, everything is simply perfect. It
          looks like something space like, it doesn't belong on our earth, it
          looks like it's supposed to be in outer space.
