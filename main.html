        This my car website! Here I will show off all the different cars I like
        and lots of information about the cars aswell, all the images are of
        free use and I would never ever take someone elses work.

          This is a Porsche Panamera Turbo S, it has a twin turbocharged V8 and
          620 horsepower at stock. It also has an Executive version, the main
          difference is the price, the Executive version also has a little bit
          more legroom which can be nice so it doesn't get so cramped in the
          car, the price difference is 177,000$ vs 188,000$
